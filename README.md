Through this project I was exploring the HTML5 canvas element with a focus on how to utilize it to create interactive art. 

I like to think of the hand as having little electrons running through its structure. As they traverse the structure, the surrounding nodes shrink in response. Then afer some time, they each run out of their energy stores and disapear.

In contast, what I refer to in the code as a supercharged electron, is dropped when the user clicks. That darts towards the nearest node on the hand, entering and racing along the structure. It causes nearby nodes to freak out and expand rapidly, only calming back down to a relaxed state when the supercharged electron has been depleted and dies.

# To Play With It:
At the terminal:
1. Clone this repository (this uses ssh)
  `git clone git@github.com:notrueblood/Interactive-Hand-Print.git`
2. Navigate into the directory that was just created
  `cd Interactive-Hand-Print`
3. Install dependencies
  `npm install`

Then open index.html
